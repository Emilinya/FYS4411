# Project 2

All the code for the project is run using the Makefile. Running `make` or `make main` will compile
the program and creates the executable `main`.

The python file `blockinator.py` contains a function that uses the blocking method to give uncertainty
estimates from saved data, and `plot.py` creates figures from saved data.
