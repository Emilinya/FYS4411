# Project 1

All the code for the project is run using the Makefile. Running `make` or `make main` will compile
the program and creates the executable `main`.

The python program `img2nums.py` creates a figure of estimated and interpolated data points from
another paper. `blockinator.py` uses the blocking method to give uncertainty estimates from saved data.
`plot/plot.py` creates figures from saved data.
